**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**
The client was a banking and money handling institution, looking for secure coding measures. The issue was related to software security, and keeping their services up to date.
**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**
Fixing dependencies and required updates was the most important aspect of their security vulnerabilities. It is important to code securily to prevent possible data breaches, affecting customers and the client. Software security adds security for both an individuals money and the companies secrets or intilectual property.
**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
The Maven dependency check was very helpful in recording possible areas of bad security. 
**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
Increasing the layers of security can be atributed to layering security software. This can also include the possibility of using ciphers as well as other forms of data masking. 
**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
I made sure to check for dependencies and run the code multiple times to make sure of functionality.
**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
Maven depenecy check will be helpful in the future, helping check for types of dependencies or security leaks.
**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
The ability to write a legible and well written report on code, and the ability to translate technical jargon into laymans terms.
